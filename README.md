## What's wrong with current social media platforms?

* **Moderation** - that's virtually unaccountable

* **Communities** - ruled by first-comers

* **Voting** - that encourages herd mentality

**Bublol is the answer to all these, and more!**

## Tags

* Instead of communities, Bublol uses tags

* Both posts and comments can be tagged

* Browse, sort, or hide content based on tags

### Why tags are better than communities?

* **No ownership** - No single person can "own" or moderate a tag globally. You decide what's relevant to you.

* **No limiting rules** - You don't need to follow any cliquey rules to comment or use a tag.

## Followers and Idols

* You **"follow"** users and make them your **"idols"**.

* Any posts/comments your idols **upvote** are **bumped**.

* Similarly, any post/comment your idols **downvote** are **buried**.

* You can also **rank** your idols to tweak the sort order further between them.

All this makes the algorithm personalized for **you**.

Essentially your front-page will be a lot unique based on who you follow.

## Moderation

(Or how to free up your independence)

* Bublol makes moderation more transparent and democratic by giving **you** the entire control over what **you** consider to be excessive.

* It is the individual who chooses and has complete governance over the boundaries of his/her personal bubble.

* The formation of your bubble is a complex process that happens over time when viewing, voting and tagging posts, deciding to follow the author, an idol, or a certain commenter on a post.

* Your idols' actions (downvoting, tagging something as "spam") can translate into your feed. But for certain actions that they may have gone overboard with, the effect can be reversed by a higher ranking idol.

All this makes the algorithm personalized for **you**. Essentially, your front-page will be much more unique based on **@who** and **#what** you follow.
